# Roadtrip Calculator
I needed a roadtrip calculator that would account for:
- Number of Cars
- For each car, fuel tank size, avg highway mpg
- Number of Legs (Point A to Point B)
- For each leg: total distance, average fuel cost per gallon (premium and regular), lodging cost for that leg

Based upon that information, calculate the total number of stops for fuel we need to make, how much it will cost at each stop and a total cost for fuel and lodging for the trip.
